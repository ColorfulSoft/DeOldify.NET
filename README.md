# How to run
* Make sure that .NET Framework 4.5 or higher is installed on your computer.
* You can use any bit depth(x32 or x64), but on a 32-bit system you will not be able to process large images due to the limited amount of memory.
* At least 3 GB of free RAM is required to run.
* Download and unpack the repository, then download DeOldify.hmodel from the releases and place it in Implementation\src\Resources.
* Run Compile.bat
* The DeOldify.NET.exe file will appear in the Implementation\Release folder. The application is ready to work!
