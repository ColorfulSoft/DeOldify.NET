# How to run
* Make sure that .NET Framework 4.5 or higher is installed on your computer.

* At least 3 GB of free RAM is required to run.
* Download and unpack the repository, then download DeOldify.hmodel from the releases(https://github.com/ColorfulSoft/DeOldify.NET/releases/download/Weights/DeOldify.hmodel) and place it in Implementation\src\Resources.
* Run Compile.bat
* The DeOldify.NET.exe file will appear in the Implementation\Release folder. The application is ready to work!
